# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

Thank you for subscribing to **Spent**.

## 1. Google Play Store Refunds

**Spent** is distributed exclusively through the Google Play Store. Therefore, all billing and refund requests are managed directly by Google.

### How to Request a Refund
If you made a purchase by accident or discover a billing issue, you can request a refund through Google Play’s support system:

1.  Go to [play.google.com/store/account/orderhistory](https://play.google.com/store/account/orderhistory).
2.  Find the order you want to return.
3.  Select **Request a refund** or **Report a problem**.
4.  Choose the option that describes your situation.
5.  Complete the form and note that you would like a refund.

For more details on Google’s refund policies, please visit [Google Play Refund Policies](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637).

## 2. Our Policy

Because Google Play manages all transactions, **we (the developers of Spent) do not have the ability to process refunds manually**. We cannot reverse charges on our end.

-   **Cancellations:** You can cancel your subscription at any time via the Google Play Store app under "Subscriptions". This will stop future charges, but it does not automatically refund past payments.
-   **Free Trial:** If you cancel during the free trial period (at least 24 hours before it ends), you will not be charged.

## 3. Contact Us

If you have persistent billing issues that Google Support cannot resolve, please contact us for guidance:
