**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the **Spent** mobile application (the "Service") operated by us.

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

## 1. Subscription & Payments

**Spent** is a paid service. We do not offer a free tier due to the costs associated with the premier AI features we provide.

### A. Subscription Plans
-   **Monthly Subscription:** $3.49 / month.
-   **Free Trial:** We offer a **14-day free trial** for new users. You will not be charged if you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends.

### B. Billing
-   Payment will be charged to your **Google Play Account** at confirmation of purchase (or after the trial period ends).
-   **Auto-Renewal:** Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
-   **Management:** You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Google Play Store settings.

### C. Refunds
-   Refund requests are handled directly by **Google Play** in accordance with their refund policy. We do not process refunds manually.

## 2. Notification Access & Privacy

To function, "Spent" requires access to your device's notifications. You acknowledge that by granting this permission, you authorize the app to process text from notifications to extract financial data. Please refer to our **Privacy Policy** for details on how we protect this data.

## 3. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of **Spent** and its licensors.

## 4. Termination

### A. By Company
We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

### B. By User (Account Deletion)
You may terminate your account at any time by using the "**Delete Account**" feature found in **Settings > Profile > Delete Account** within the application.
-   **Data Deletion:** This action is irreversible. All your data stored on our servers will be permanently deleted immediately.
-   **Subscriptions:** Deleting your account directly within the app does **not** automatically cancel your subscription. You must manually cancel your subscription in your **Google Play Store settings** to avoid future charges.
